label: 'Cern'
excerpt: 'Dispatch Recordings proudly presents a long-awaited return to drum and bass for Cern, as he marks his return to the label with the brooding Desire Path EP. Known for his dark and brooding take on the genre, veteran Cern delivers five richly textured, rolling, deep-cuts on this impressive varied EP. The drum-heavy title track Desire Path reveals a tense, rugged journey through spacial soundscapes punctured with precision drum edits. The EP balances dark and light throughout, with each track revealing a different side to Cerns atmospheric productions.'

Dispatch Recordings proudly presents a long-awaited return to drum and bass for Cern, as he marks his return to the label with the brooding Desire Path EP.

Known for his dark and brooding take on the genre, veteran Cern delivers five richly textured, rolling, deep-cuts on this impressive varied EP.

The EP balances dark and light throughout, with each track revealing a different side to Cerns atmospheric productions.
