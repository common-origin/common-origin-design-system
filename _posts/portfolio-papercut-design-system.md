## PaperCut Design System

Since 2019, my role at PaperCut has evolved to encompass both design and development, particularly as a Design System advocate in an environment that initially lacked one. This position has required me to wear many hats, from conceptual design to hands-on coding and strategic planning.

### Delivering Consistency Across the Business

During my tenure, I’ve successfully developed and maintained three distinct Design Systems across different areas of the business. My primary goal has been to bring brand and design consistency to our diverse customer and partner experiences. By doing so, we've not only enhanced the user journey but also streamlined the delivery process, making it faster and more efficient for our teams.

A central pillar of this work has been the implementation of Design Tokens—design decisions encapsulated in variables. These tokens are used across products and customer touchpoints, managed from a single source, and accessible to both developers and designers within their respective tool stacks. This approach has significantly improved the coherence and efficiency of our design processes.

### Website Design System

My journey at PaperCut began with developing design patterns for the Web & Marketing team. Initially focused on design, my role quickly expanded into Front-End Development, where I built the components, design patterns, and architecture that formed the foundation of our Website Design System. This system empowers the entire business to contribute to the website while ensuring that the UI remains on-brand and delivers a consistent user experience.

### Email Design System

One challenge we encountered was the inconsistency in our external communications. Emails from different product teams and business areas often looked disconnected, leading to a lack of trust among potential users. Recognizing this, I took the initiative to develop design patterns, guidelines, and coded components and templates that would help our teams deliver a unified experience across all email communications.

### Product Design System

The Product Design System is now the most robust and advanced of all the systems I’ve developed at PaperCut. Our software teams rely on this system for its reliability and ease of use. It provides accessible UI components and supports the design and implementation of new features in a manner that feels intuitive and user-friendly.

For designers, the challenge lies in balancing creativity and flair with the need for an intuitive user experience, established design patterns, and adherence to WCAG accessibility guidelines. For engineers, comprehensive documentation and regular collaboration have been crucial in building trust in the Design System.

### Advocacy and Expansion

Effective communication has been a key component of my role—more so than I initially anticipated. The notion that "If you build it, they will come" doesn’t fully capture the complexity of managing expectations across an organisation. It requires understanding different skill levels, roles, and responsibilities.

After leading the design and development of the initial Product Design System, I advocated to senior leadership for expanding our Front-End capacity within Product Development. This expansion was necessary to support the continued growth of the Design System. Today, we have a small team of dedicated practitioners, and I work closely with them, pairing with and educating teams and individuals across the business to build a stronger design culture and foster further advocacy for our systems.
