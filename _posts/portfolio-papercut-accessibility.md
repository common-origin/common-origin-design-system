## My role in Accessibiliity
As Design System Lead at PaperCut, I’ve been deeply involved in promoting and implementing accessible design and development practices.

Accessibility is a critical part of building usable software, and my passion for this area has led me to work directly on solving accessibility issues, easing the load on our product teams. By conducting research and collaborating across teams, I advocate for accessibility initiatives and educate others on the importance of designing for all users. Sometimes, I even have to go undercover and just get it done.

## Understanding our users
To create truly accessible solutions, understanding user needs is paramount. I have actively engaged with customers worldwide to learn about the challenges their users face, and to build partnerships that help us deliver more inclusive products by working directly with them.

For instance, I have been engaged with a customer of ours in Colorado, USA, to discuss the new legislation that is coming into law in July 2025. The customer was required to check whether their software suppliers are WCAG compliant - the concern being if not, they (customer) may be liable. This ongoing relationship has helped us improve our understanding of designing and building accessible software by working directly with them and their users. I have found this to be a great way to navigate a complex environment, and how to discover what kind of real-world impact small tweaks can make to a whole lot of users.

For internal feedback loops regarding accessibility, connecting with our support teams in different regions has provided valuable insights into user pain points and their impact. This feedback is used to find areas of concern for Product Development to improve in our software, while illuminating where to spend our energy on educating and levelling-up teams in accessibility workshops.

In addition to gathering external feedback, I’ve established channels for recording and sharing accessibility-related issues, enabling cross-functional discussions and collaborative problem-solving among product, engineering, and design leaders.

## Education and Advocacy
Educating our teams on accessibility best practices is crucial. I teach product designers how to use browser tools to assess accessibility compliance and guide engineers on implementing accessible design solutions. Conducting workshops helps teams understand the necessary process changes for building accessible software more efficiently. My continuous research into UI design best practices for accessibility, along with consultations with accessibility experts, keeps our approach informed and effective.

## Measuring accessibility compliance
Running accessibility audits is a key part of my role. Given that some of our products have been evolving for over 15 years, these assessments can be complex. Understanding international accessibility standards, knowing when legislative changes come into effect, and assessing our company’s compliance obligations are critical components of these audits. I document issues and establish processes that enable teams to prioritize and incorporate these into their development sprints.

## Inclusive design practices
Promoting accessibility requires advocacy at all levels of the organization. I work with leadership to highlight the importance of inclusive design and its impact on the product development lifecycle. Centralizing our Design System and component library plays a pivotal role in helping engineers build accessible products consistently. My work includes developing a Design Token system that standardizes accessible colors, typography, and other elements across our product suite.

Encouraging teams to incorporate small accessibility tasks into their sprints allows us to progressively improve our software's inclusivity. This approach not only aligns with our commitment to accessible design but also enables us to share a compelling narrative with our customers about our ongoing efforts to make our software more inclusive.
